Part 1 (bash + file navigation)
------------------------------
For all of the following questions, copy and paste the terminal commands that you use to acheive them into this file.

1. Create a directory called "lec5_directory".

    mkdir lec5_directory

2. Change directories into lec5_directory

    cd lec5_directory

3. Create a file called "names.txt".

  touch names.txt

4. Use `echo` and `>` and/or `>>` to write the names of you and your partner into the file names.txt.

  echo "Eric Ha, Rebecca Donohoe" > names.txt


5. Create a copy of "names.txt" called "names2.txt".

  cp names.txt names2.txt

6. Create a directory called lec5_subdirectory and create a directory within lec5_subdirectory called subsubbasement.

  mkdir -p lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement


7. Move to your subsubbasement directory.

  cd lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement/

8. Find your full path.

  pwd

9. Without changing directories, move names2.txt to the subsubbasement directory.

  mv ~/.../lec5_directory/names2.txt ~/.../lec5_directory/lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement

10. Move back to your lec5_directory.

  cd ~/.../lec5_directory

11. Create a directory called thisissilly

  mkdir thisissilly

12. Using the `rm` command, remove the thisissilly directory

  rm -r thisissilly

13. Run the following code:
for i in `seq 1 30`; do
    touch "$i.silly"
done;

14. List all files in your directory ending in .silly. Use a "*" wildcard with `ls`.

  ls *.silly

15. List all files in your directory between 10.silly and 19.silly (inclusive). Use `ls` with a "?" wildcard (matches 1 single character).

  ls [10:19]?.silly

16. Close this file (Really!), then move it into your lec5_directory using the `mv` command.

  mv ~/.../lec5_exercises.txt ~/.../lec5_directory

17. Use the `less` command and the `cat` command on this file. What are the differences?

  Less displays the contents of the file, but you could also run commands on the file with 'less' commands like moving forward/backward a line
  or searching for a character.

  Cat displays the contents of the file then quickly a new command line prompt follows.

18. Change directories to the parent directory of lec5_directory.

  cd ..

19. What command will you use to zip up your lec5_directory and all files and subdirectories to produce lec5.zip? (Answer, then do this and turn your zip file in on moodle). You can use `unzip -l lec5.zip` to check the contents of your zip file.

  zip lec5.zip lec5_directory
